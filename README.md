## Convert from Salado Player
`cube_faces_from_salado.sh`

This is primary to share a script I have made to convert a spherical panorama published to the web using the old flash plugin "Salado Player". In its first version it converts the images to be used by krpano plugin, but possibly the mult-iresolution tiles from cube faces can also be used by other publishing solutions, like Marzipano.
